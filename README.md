# Fix GPT-5's Horrible Downgrade - Restore Your ChatGPT to Peak Performance

Frustrated with GPT-5? You're not alone. Thousands of users are reporting the same issues: colder, robotic responses, more hallucinations, and a general horrible downgrade from the GPT-4o they loved.

It's not you. It's the model. But we have the fix.

These powerful custom instructions were engineered to override GPT-5's worst tendencies and force it to deliver the high-quality, reliable responses you need.

## 🔍 Are You Experiencing These GPT-5 Issues?

Be honest with yourself. If you're dealing with any of the following, this is the solution you've been searching for.

- [ ] Colder, robotic responses? (Missing the warmth and personality of GPT-4o)
- [ ] Increased hallucinations? (Making things up with confidence)
- [ ] Shallow, insufficient answers? (Giving you short, rushed, useless replies)
- [ ] Inaccurate or unverified information? (Presenting guesses as facts)

If you checked ANY box, these custom instructions are your solution.

## 🛠️ How These Instructions Fix GPT-5's Core Problems

This isn't just a simple prompt. It's a strict protocol that reprograms GPT-5's behavior at its core.

### Forces High-Reasoning Mode

Counters the "shallow" problem by demanding deep, step-by-step analysis before answering. No more rushed, superficial responses.

### Enforces Zero-Tolerance for Hallucinations

Mandates that every claim must be fact-based and verifiable. If it can't be verified, it must decline to answer rather than make things up.

### Restores Contextual Awareness

Implements strict rules to maintain context, eliminating out-of-context answers that derail your conversations.

### Mandates Factual Verification

Forces the model to cite sources and stick strictly to verifiable data, ending the "inaccurate information" problem that plagues GPT-5.

## 🔒 Bonus Tip: Disable Memory to Improve Privacy & Focus

Disabling ChatGPT's memory helps improve privacy and keep conversations focused by preventing it from remembering details across sessions.

### When to Disable ChatGPT Memory

- For sensitive information: Prevents details from one conversation (like a client's pricing) from being used in another
- For short-term tasks: Ensures data from one session isn't carried over to the next, making responses cleaner and more focused
- To avoid irrelevant context: Prevents the AI from bringing up past, unrelated topics during a new conversation

### How to Disable Memory

1. Go to your profile > Settings
2. Select Personalization
3. Scroll down to find Memory
4. Toggle it off
